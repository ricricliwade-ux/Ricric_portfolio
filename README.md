I dont understand but I have decided to be continue to learn every hard, I play win and refuse to loss
In creating my portfolio, I applied several UI/UX principles to make it both functional and user-friendly. One of the first principles I used was consistency in design—through the use of a simple color scheme, readable fonts, and a clear layout. This helped maintain visual harmony and allowed users to navigate the portfolio without confusion. I also applied the principle of user-centered design, making sure the navigation bar was easy to access and the sections (About, Projects/Activities, and Contact) were well-labeled. Additionally, I considered responsiveness, ensuring that the site adapts to different screen sizes so users can view it smoothly whether on desktop or mobile.
The main challenges I faced were mostly technical. At first, I struggled with aligning elements properly and making the navigation bar responsive. It was frustrating to see layouts breaking when switching from desktop to mobile view. I solved this by studying tutorials on CSS Flexbox and Grid, and by testing the portfolio on multiple devices. Another challenge was balancing design and content—I had to avoid overcrowding the site while still presenting enough information. To solve this, I kept content concise and used whitespace effectively.
For future improvements, I would like to add interactive elements such as hover effects and animations to make the site more engaging. I also plan to integrate a contact form connected to email for better communication. Lastly, I want to improve accessibility by adding alt text to images and ensuring proper contrast for readability. These improvements would enhance the overall user experience and make the portfolio more professional.
